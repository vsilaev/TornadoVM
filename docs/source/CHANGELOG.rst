TornadoVM 0.14
--------------

15/06/2022

New Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  New device memory management for addressing the memory allocation
   limitations of OpenCL and enabling pinned memory of device buffers.

   -  The execution of task-schedules will still automatically
      allocate/deallocate memory every time a task-schedule is executed,
      unless lock/unlock functions are invoked explicitly at the
      task-schedule level.
   -  One heap per device has been replaced with a device buffer per
      input variable.
   -  A new API call has been added for releasing memory:
      ``unlockObjectFromMemory``
   -  A new API call has been added for locking objects to the device:
      ``lockObjectInMemory`` This requires the user to release memory by
      invoking ``unlockObjectFromMemory`` at the task-schedule level.

-  Enhanced Live Task migration by supporting multi-backend execution
   (PTX <-> OpenCL <-> SPIR-V).
